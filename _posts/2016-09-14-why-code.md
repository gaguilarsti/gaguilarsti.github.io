title: Why Learn to Code at 33?
---

There is not much I can complain about, really.  I've had a good career, working at great companies (Hewlett Packard as an intern, Intel right out of college, Microsoft for the past 9.5 years and 9104 Studios, my own mini-startup) and my career has advanced at a fairly accelerated pace.  

Born in rural Mexico, illegally immigrating to the US as a child and being somewhat poor growing up, I've exceeded most people's expectations on education and generally being a productive member of society.

I have worked and work on interesting and challenging problems, with interesting and challenging people and I can't complain about the compensation. Well, aside from my startup - that job has paid a negative salary.   I've travelled the world and been to places that some of my family members didn't know existed.  

But, through the years and especially being in the technology industry, I've always had that urge to build something of my own.  Prior to 9104 Studios, I would dabble in trainings, little things here and there but nothing ever stuck.  Then Manu and I got started on [Track Attack](http://www.trackattackapp.com) which would end up being our first product.  He, and then our technical team, would develop and I would lead product strategy, testing and everything else.  This, coupled with a change in role at Microsoft, directly into an engineering organization, as a Product Planner, started to address that urge I had but it wasn't enough.

I wanted to contribute, especially when I saw how hard my team members at 9104 Studios and Microsoft were working.  I also wanted to have an idea, draw something up in Sketch and be able to put together a functional prototype on my own, when the inspiration hit me.  This would help a ton working at Microsoft and even more with my startup, where our biggest technical weakness was in web development. 

Those are the first two reasons but the biggest reason, is that I simply wanted to learn.  I love pushing my self to do something I would have never imagined I could have done, especially if I'm passionate about it.

There are several things that I've done in my life where I started from scratch and had to truly push myself to learn something different, not just extend a knowledge I already have or take a week long boot camp.  Web Development and what I hope will move into broader software development and computer science is that next thing for me that will be the driving force of the next phase of my life.

I've really enjoyed the first decade of my life (plus a few years) focused on business but I can't wait to see what will come out of the next decade and the crazy new thing I'll try to take on when I am 43.  

Now back to living life doing the things I want to do, for several hours, in front of a computer.
