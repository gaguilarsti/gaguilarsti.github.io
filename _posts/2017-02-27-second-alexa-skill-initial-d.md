title: Initial D Fact Skill for Alexa

For the second Alexa Skill, it was a little more straight forward, this time creating a Fact Skill, which has fewer, or closer to no dependencies on any external libraries or resources.  The main reason is that there really isn't much interaction between the user and Alexa.

Essentially, the user asks Alexa to provide (through a variety of different utterances) a fact, and Alexa randomly selects one fact to provide, at a time.

The template provided by Amazon was once again, super straight forward and we used an Amazon Web Services Lambda.  Aside from setting up the lambda and the skill on the Amazon developer portals, the only work was to decide what topic to focus on, gather facts and edit the appropriate content files.

So what topic did I pick?

### Initial D Geek

I decided to create the [Initial D](https://www.funimation.com/shows/initial-d/) Geek Amazon Alexa skill.  What exactly is Initial D?  Let me just leave this first episode here for you to watch for yourself and find out.

Ok, are you back?

I'm assuming it's been two weeks from when you started watching the first episode of Initial D?  You got past the crazy intro music and binge watched all available seasons and episodes on the internet?

You also traded in your Toyota Rav 4 for what the local drifter kid assured you was a super sweet and totally JDM Hachi-Roku?  You also started carrying an open lid cup of water in that new AE86 everywhere you drive?

I don't blame you, it's amazing isn't it?

But not only are you all new to the mountain pass racing and drifting scene, you might be reading this from the geographic location where your mountains are more like buttes.  So you're not going to impress anyone at the local meetups with your awesome sliding and dropping a wheel inside a gutter, skills.  So what to do?

That's right, enable the Alexa Initial D skill for your Amazon Echo.  Compensate for your crappy racing technique and general lack of mechanical knowledge with a fact book of Initial D that would make a [Britannica Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica) jealous.  Note - do not let the kids at the car meetup know that **you know** what a Britannica Encyclopedia even is.  This will age you more than... well... your age and general appearance.  Plus, they won't believe that there was a printed version of Wikipedia.  

With Initial D Geek, you can wake up each day and ask Alexa for an awesome fact to drop knowledge on your co-workers, who are also confused as to why you started growing bangs.  Here are some examples of what Initial D Geek will school you on:
1. Redacted to not give away the secrets (which are actually facts)
2. Also redacted
3. Fact so good, we couldn't not redacted (yes, that is a double negative)
